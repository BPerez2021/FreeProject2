# FreeProject2

I had some struggles initially due to my computer not wanting to run cells in VSC.
Coming into the computer lab, I worked on a lab computer to actual complete the assignment.
I decided to work on 11-1 and image manipulation.
I was able to use one of the phrase you mentioned you liked that was generated from FreeProjectOne. I attempted to blur the image, without desired results.
I then decided to attempt to use actual images to manipulate. On the first attempt, my goal was to rotate an image. Unfortunately, it did not work.
I then came to the realization that I had forgotten to download the image to the repository. So I downloaded an image and on the first save, it oddly saved it as a JFIF even though I had saved it as a JPEG. I finally save it properly as a JPEG and used the same code from the inital attempt of the manipulation of actual images and was successful.
I then rotated the image to different degrees.
